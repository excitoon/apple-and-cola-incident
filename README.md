# Apple and Cola Incident

## Incident Description

On March 18, a Coca-Cola Zero was spilled over an Apple MacBook Pro M3 Pro. The owner, unfamiliar with macOS, attempted to power it off but accidentally put it to sleep instead. The laptop was then gently wiped, a napkin was placed between the screen and keyboard, and it was positioned upside down for approximately 30 minutes to allow liquid to drain.

After waiting, the MacBook did not turn on, so it was taken to a service center. The service center was able to power it on, at which point it was immediately shut down again. The technicians spent about 2 hours cleaning the device.

## Observed Symptoms

Upon receiving the device back from the service center:

- Key **N** did not work.
- The service center indicated keyboard replacement would be required, citing a mechanical issue.
- After returning home, the entire column containing **H**, **Y**, **6**, and **N** was affected.
- **N** was producing incorrect characters (a **/** symbol and other unintended characters) instead of or in addition to `N`.
- Extra symbols were appearing spontaneously from the keyboard without any keys being pressed.
- Over the following days the picture evolved: **N** now produces 3 different symbols (including `N` itself), and similar multi-character behavior is present for the other keys in the affected column.

## Keyboard Electronics: Schematics and Layout

### 1. Keyboard Matrix Principle

MacBook keyboards use a **row/column matrix** to detect keypresses. Each key sits at the intersection of one row wire and one column wire. The keyboard controller scans all rows one at a time and reads which column lines are active. This means:

- One **column** trace is shared by all keys in the same vertical column on the keyboard.
- One **row** trace is shared by all keys in the same horizontal row.
- A keypress is detected when a specific (row, column) pair is simultaneously active.

```
          COL_A   COL_B   COL_C   COL_D   COL_E   COL_F
           |       |       |       |       |       |
ROW_1 ---[Tab]---[Q]-----[W]-----[E]-----[R]-----[T]--- ...
           |       |       |       |       |       |
ROW_2 ---[CpsLk]-[A]-----[S]-----[D]-----[F]-----[G]--- ...
           |       |       |       |       |       |
ROW_3 ---[Shift]-[Z]-----[X]-----[C]-----[V]-----[B]--- ...
           |       |       |       |       |       |
          ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...
```

Each intersection square `[KEY]` contains a tiny rubber dome or scissor-switch membrane that, when pressed, electrically connects the row wire to the column wire at that point.

### 2. Affected Column in the Keyboard Matrix

The keys **6**, **Y**, **H**, and **N** all sit in the **same column** on the physical MacBook keyboard layout. They are connected to a single column trace that runs vertically through the keyboard membrane/FPC from top to bottom:

```

           ▲
           │

```

A single conductive contamination or corrosion point anywhere along this column trace (or at the connector pin that carries it) will affect all four keys simultaneously.

### 3. Keyboard Flex Cable (FPC) and Connector

The MacBook keyboard is built into a large **Flexible Printed Circuit (FPC)** — a thin, ribbon-like PCB that carries all the row and column traces from the key matrix down to a connector at the bottom of the top-case assembly.

```

#### ZIF Connector Detail

A ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) connector has a row of gold-plated pads on the FPC that line up with spring contacts inside the socket. A locking latch clamps the cable in place. If the FPC is:

- **Inserted at a slight offset**: one or more pins shift, and a column or row trace connects to the wrong controller input pin — causing wrong characters.
- **Not fully inserted**: contact resistance is high or intermittent, causing missing or unreliable keypresses.
- **Inserted upside-down** (some cables are not keyed): the pin order is completely reversed, producing systematic wrong-character output across many keys.

### 4. How Liquid Damage Causes the Observed Symptoms

The following diagram illustrates where cola can bridge traces and produce the observed multi-character and ghost-key behavior:

  └────────────┴────────────────────┴────────────────────┘

               Conductive bridge between COL_D and COL_E
               → pressing any key in COL_D also activates
                 a COL_E signal → wrong extra character output
               → residual conductivity even when no key is
                 pressed → spontaneous ghost keypresses
```

### 5. Physical Location of the Connector on an M3 Pro MacBook

On the MacBook Pro M3, the keyboard FPC runs from the key area down to the **lower portion of the top-case**, where it connects to the logic board via a ZIF socket located roughly in the center-bottom of the top-case interior. Liquid spilled on the keyboard travels downward by gravity and capillary action, meaning the **connector and the lower portion of the FPC** are among the most likely sites for residue accumulation — consistent with all affected keys being in a single vertical column rather than a single horizontal row.

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Residual liquid causing short circuits (most likely)

Cola contains water, sugar, acids, and other conductive impurities. Even after the initial drying period, residual moisture or dried sugar residue can remain in tight spaces — especially under the butterfly/scissor key mechanism or on the underlying flex-cable connector pads. When the keyboard is in use and the device warms up, residual conductivity between adjacent key traces can cause:

- A single key contact to trigger multiple key signals (explaining the 3-symbol behavior on **N**).
- Adjacent keys in the same matrix column (H, Y, 6, N) to be affected together, since they share a common column trace on the keyboard matrix PCB/flex cable.
- Spontaneous keypresses, as moisture bridges two traces that should not be connected.

The fact that the affected keys form a **single column** of the keyboard matrix is strong evidence of a column-trace short or contamination on the column wire, rather than individual key damage.

### Hypothesis 2: Incorrect reattachment of the keyboard flex-cable connector

The thin-film (ZIF/FFC) keyboard connector on MacBooks is fragile and directional. If the service center disconnected and reconnected it incorrectly — e.g., inserted at a slight angle, not fully seated, or with the locking latch not fully engaged — this can cause:

- Intermittent or missing contact on specific pins, producing missing or garbled keystrokes.
- A shifted contact alignment causing one column's signals to be read on the wrong row or column, producing wrong characters.

This was the owner's initial hypothesis and was tested by asking the service center to reseat the connector. However, the symptoms persisted, making this a less likely **sole** cause, though it could be a **contributing factor** if combined with liquid damage.

### Hypothesis 3: Damaged keyboard membrane / flex cable traces

If the liquid caused corrosion or a physical break on the flexible printed circuit (FPC) that runs under the keyboard, specific traces could be:

- Open (broken): key produces no output.
- Shorted to an adjacent trace: key produces multiple outputs or triggers neighboring keys.

Corrosion on flex-cable traces is a known consequence of cola spills due to the acidic and sugary composition of the liquid. This damage can worsen over time as oxidation progresses, which aligns with the observation that symptoms evolved and worsened over several days.

### Hypothesis 4: Damage to the keyboard controller IC

The keyboard controller (embedded in the T2 chip area or in the top-case assembly on Apple Silicon MacBooks) interprets signals from the key matrix. If liquid reached the controller and caused partial damage, it could misinterpret column signals and generate phantom keypresses or incorrect key codes. This is less likely than trace-level damage but possible if liquid penetration was significant.

## Most Probable Root Cause

The most probable explanation is a **combination of Hypotheses 1 and 3**: sticky, conductive residue (dried cola) remained on the keyboard flex cable or membrane after the service cleaning, creating persistent shorts across a single keyboard matrix column (H, Y, 6, N). This accounts for:

1. The affected keys forming a clean column pattern.
2. Multiple symbols being generated by a single keypress.
3. Spontaneous keypresses.
4. Symptoms worsening over time as residue dried and corrosion progressed.

The connector misalignment (Hypothesis 2) may have introduced additional artifacts but is unlikely to be the primary cause since reseating the connector did not resolve the issue.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Thorough ultrasonic cleaning** of the keyboard assembly and/or top case using isopropyl alcohol or a specialized electronics cleaner, with particular attention to the keyboard flex cable and the column traces for H, Y, 6, and N.
2. **Visual inspection under magnification** of the FPC traces in the affected column for corrosion, cracks, or residue bridges.
3. **Resistance measurement** between the column trace shared by H/Y/6/N and adjacent traces to confirm whether a short is present.
4. If cleaning does not resolve the issue, **keyboard/top-case replacement** will likely be necessary, as corrosion damage to flex-cable traces is generally not repairable without specialized equipment.
